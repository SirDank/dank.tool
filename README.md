# 🚨 SirDank's dank.tool 🚨

- An all-in-one, portable windows executable with a wide variety of features built with python!

- This tool will rarely need to be updated as it executes the latest source code straight from GitHub for both the [tool](https://github.com/SirDank/dank.tool/blob/main/__src__/dank.tool.py) itself and its [modules](https://github.com/SirDank/dank.tool/tree/main/__modules__)!

## Quickstart

- Run the [dank.tool.exe](https://github.com/SirDank/dank.tool/releases)

- Note: If you would like to run the python scripts instead, there might be small changes you might have to make for it to execute properly.

## Note

- The dank.tool executable might be flagged as malware (false positive) since it has been built using python (nuitka).

- Python is not required to use the protable exe version of this tool.

- Try to not spam the [ ENTER ] key on the exe's terminal, as it can cause the program to take in the wrong input, if this has occurred, close the exe and relaunch it.

## Short URLs

- Github Short URL: https://bit.ly/dank-tool

- Direct download: https://bit.ly/dank-tool-download
